## Lightweight http static files server in python

Project inspired by Gynvael's ["HTTP Server in 1h" livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5JQQrZDy4o). I use the same concept of starting a thread for each connection via [threading lib](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/threading.html#module-threading).

### Usage
This code is being written for educational purposes only, therefore **should NOT be used** on any internet-exposed machine for security reasons.
